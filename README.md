# Machine Learning Classification Repository
This repository contains two classification projects: credit card default prediction and mobile price classification. We used Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, XG Boost Classifier, Light GBM Classifier, CatBoost Classifier, and SVM Classifier models for classification. In the end, we deployed our models using the Streamlit library.

## Credit Card Default Prediction
The goal of this project was to predict whether a credit card customer will default on their payment or not. We used the credit card default dataset obtained from Kaggle.

We performed classification analysis using Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, XG Boost Classifier, Light GBM Classifier, CatBoost Classifier, and SVM Classifier.

## Mobile Price Classification
The goal of this project was to classify mobile phones based on their price range. We used the mobile price classification dataset obtained from Kaggle.

We performed classification analysis using Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, XG Boost Classifier, Light GBM Classifier, CatBoost Classifier, and SVM Classifier.

Files and Folders
credit_card_default_prediction: contains the code and data related to the credit card default prediction project.
mobile_price_classification: contains the code and data related to the mobile price classification project.
streamlit_deployed_models: contains the code for deploying the models using Streamlit.
README.md: provides an overview of the repository.
Getting Started
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm, catboost, and streamlit.

Conclusion
Overall, the classification models were able to predict the credit card default and mobile price classification with reasonable accuracy. The Streamlit library was used to deploy the models as a web app.
